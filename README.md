# TwoJobOpenings

I am interested in these two positions because the course has rekindled my passion for computer games, especially with recent classes that used constructors to develop both characters and simulations. As a writer I made world-building one of my foremost strengths, and the highest quality computer games rely on this aspect, to which I would contribute.

The Electronic Arts opening therefore drew my attention because of its location and niche. I have had extensive experience in HTML and SQL since before the Bootcamp course, and the current lessons on database and code base systems would help prepare me for this position’s qualifications. The course has also taught me much about API programming, another important requirement for the given position.

What would require further research and training for me is writing in C++, one of the priorities for this position.

Although this position lists a series of job responsibilities, the foremost concerns the ability to produce 3-D media for multiple platforms. Its recommendations include experience in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, DreamWeaver, and PHP, all of which I have used to a significant degree.

However, the principal requirement is experience with at least one major 3-D rendering program, and so I am planning to learn the Unity platform, which can be programmed in either C# or JavaScript. Unity’s “componential” quality is already reminding me of features I am learning about in ReactJS, so I will be interested to see how they overlap.
